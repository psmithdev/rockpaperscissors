 Project: Rock Paper Scissors 

Simple grade-school style game of "Rock paper scissors" through the browser console.

Pseudo/Plan:

Game will be played against the computer.

1. Write a function "getComputerChoice" that will randomly return either "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors".

2. Write a function that plays a single round of rock paper scissors. The function will have two parameters "playerSelection" and "computerSelection", return a string declaring the winner.

<<<<<<< HEAD //decided no arrays for this, that is the challenge
Make function "playerSelection" case-insensitive.

Make an array [0, 1 ,2] and assign each number to a string.  Example: 0 = rock, 1 = paper, 2 = scissors.

Start off with just 2-3 choices.  Expand to Rock, Paper, Scissors, LIZARD and SPOCK.

How to make computer know which string beats which?
Rock beats scissors? rock > scissors
Paper > rock
Scissors > paper

paper = paper is a draw
scissors = scissors is a draw
rock = rock is a draw
