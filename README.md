 Project: Rock Paper Scissors 

Simple grade-school style game of "Rock paper scissors" through the browser console.

Pseudo/Plan:

Game will be played against the computer.

1. Write a function "getComputerChoice" that will randomly return either "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors".

2. Write a function that plays a single round of rock paper scissors. The function will have two parameters "playerSelection" and "computerSelection", return a string declaring the winner.

Make function "playerSelection" case-insensitive.
